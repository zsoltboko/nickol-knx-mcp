# nickol-knx-mcp

**A design-time KNX / ETS6 assistant exposed as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server.**

Four things you can do with it — all **without ever touching the live KNX bus**:

1. **Design a project from a spec** — turn an equipment list / project specification into a complete, validated group-address structure **plus the full implementation document set** (ETS-importable XML/CSV, human-readable report, Home Assistant YAML, acceptance test protocol, as-built handover pack).
2. **Audit, repair & finish an existing project** — validate naming · DPT & sub-DPT · command↔status · KNX Secure · Matter-readiness, get **concrete fix proposals** (inferred DPTs, synthesised status GAs), grade completeness, and diff two project versions.
3. **Generate the smart-home layer** — assembled Home Assistant entities (colour lights, climate, covers, sensors) that read *real device state*, with everything ambiguous deferred to human review.
4. **Compose a new project from parametrised room templates** — from a list of rooms (with a `basic`/`comfort` preset per slot) assemble a **new**, validated project → an allocation manifest + ETS GA XML/CSV + a device BOM proposal. Dry-run, new projects only (**R1**).

Under the hood: a **device library** that expands each actuator into its real communication objects — from generic recipes up to the **exact vendor object model** parsed straight from ETS application programs.

## 🧪 Status & call for testers

This is a **public beta**. The full pipeline passes an end-to-end smoke test on a synthetic
project and has been validated against **real multi-thousand-GA ETS5/ETS6 projects** (anonymised) —
but real ETS projects are wonderfully messy and diverse, and more field reports make it better.

**👉 If you have an ETS5/ETS6 project, please try it and tell us what happens.** Open a
[Real-project test report](https://github.com/NickoScope/nickol-knx-mcp/issues/new?template=real_project_test.yml)
issue. The tool is read-only and never connects to a bus, so testing is safe (see
[Safety model](#-safety-model)). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

💬 **[Join the discussion →](https://github.com/NickoScope/nickol-knx-mcp/discussions/1)** — say hi, ask anything, or share what the tool found on your project.

## 🗺️ Roadmap — shaped by real integrators

Recent reviews from practising KNX integrators (in [Discussions](https://github.com/NickoScope/nickol-knx-mcp/discussions)) are steering what comes next:

- **Cross-device parameter consistency** *(shipped — `check_device_parameters`)* — flag the one device whose ETS **parameter** settings differ from its N identical siblings: a thermostat with a different setpoint/hysteresis, a presence detector with a different detection time. Extracts per-device parameters straight from the `.knxproj` and finds the odd one out on real 42–275-device projects — read-only, no ETS, no bus — and correctly reports **nothing** on a clean project (no false positives across a different vendor / integrator school).
- **Project Policy Profile** *(shipped — `check_policy`)* — validate a project against *your own* agreed rules (naming, GA taxonomy, command/status exemptions) instead of one universal "professional standard", since conventions differ per integrator; with no profile it validates against the taxonomy inferred from the project itself.
- **Room Template Library** — compose a **new** project from parametrised room templates. **R1 shipped** (`compose_rooms` + `validate_room_template`: new projects, dry-run, allocation manifest + ETS XML/CSV + device BOM). **R2 planned**: docking into an existing project + exact device selection.
- On **in-ETS group-address linking** we deliberately *don't* reinvent the wheel: for linking GAs to communication objects inside ETS there are already ETS App-Store add-ins today, and native **Smart Linking** is coming in ETS7 — we point you to those and keep our focus on read-only **audit** and an **evidential project model**.

## Why this exists

As of mid-2026 there is **no off-the-shelf ETS6 ↔ Claude / MCP tool**. The KNX community has
been explicitly asking for an integration that can inspect and help modify projects (adding /
renaming devices and group addresses) through an AI/CLI workflow. This package fills exactly the
**design-time** layer — the missing one.

The recommended full setup is four layers; only one needs to be built from scratch:

| Layer | Purpose | What to use | Build it? |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 1. Live | states, control, debugging a running house | **official Home Assistant MCP Server** + KNX (XKNX) integration | No, already exists |
| 2. **Design-time** | parse `.knxproj`, validate DPT/naming/status + GA-intent de-noise, generate HA YAML (colour lights + climate assembled) & ETS XML/CSV | **`nickol-knx-mcp` (this package)** | **YES — this is the gap** |
| 3. Files + Git | YAML/CSV/XML, versioning the address schema | standard filesystem + git MCP servers | No, already exists |
| 4. Skill | design rules (GA structure, naming, DPT, scenes) + ops discipline | `CLAUDE.md` + [`skills/`](skills/ha-git-backup) (ha-git-backup ops companion) | No, included |

> **Safety by design:** layer 2 (this server) **physically cannot** connect to a bus. It has no
> network/bus dependency at all — it only reads `.knxproj` and writes files into a confined
> workspace. The "never write to a live bus" requirement is enforced **structurally**, not by
> promise. Any real interaction with the house goes only through layer 1 (Home Assistant).

---

## What you can do with it

### 📐 Scenario 1 — Design a project from a spec (spec → implementation kit)

Turn a project specification (equipment schedules, cable journals, a device list) into a complete,
validated group-address structure — and the **full document set to implement it**:

1. **Device list → object model.** Each device expands into its real communication objects via the
   device library (`decompose_device`): a dimmer channel is on/off + status + relative dim (3.007) +
   absolute value (5.001) + brightness status — not "one GA"; a floor-heating zone is 8 objects; a
   pulse meter is 6.
2. **The professional logic layer.** A bare spec never mentions what makes a project *complete*:
   central & zone macros, scenes, presence logic, climate-control scaffolding, sun/wind shutter
   logic, leak→shut-off chains, astro/meteo and date-time sources, reserves in every range. The
   methodology encodes these completeness patterns — distilled from the KNX Association standard,
   public manufacturer documentation and the study of real professional as-built ETS projects
   (anonymised).
3. **Structure & discipline.** 3-level addressing, zone+function naming, command↔status pairing,
   a DPT on every address.
4. **Deliverables** (one command each): ETS-importable **XML/CSV** · Markdown **report** ·
   **Home Assistant YAML** · functional **acceptance test protocol** · as-built **handover pack**
   (inventory, GA map, coverage %, Secure posture, QA findings, topology SVG).

Full methodology: [`docs/spec-to-structure.md`](docs/spec-to-structure.md). Field-checked by
reconstructing a real as-built ETS project (3,600+ group addresses) from its specification alone:
**~92 % structural match** (taxonomy, domains, automation logic, DPT distribution) at **zero
validation errors** — the remaining delta is the integrator's per-device parameterisation, which no
spec encodes.

### 🔍 Scenario 2 — Audit, repair & finish an existing project

- **Read & classify.** Parses password-protected ETS5/ETS6 `.knxproj` via
  [`xknxproject`](https://github.com/XKNX/xknxproject); classifies every GA by category
  (lighting / shutter / hvac / sensor / scene / energy / diagnostics) and kind (command / status /
  sensor) from the DPT + multilingual (EN/DE/RU) name keywords. GA **purpose tagging**
  (`functional` / `reserve` / `logic` / `scratch`) keeps intentional placeholders out of the error
  lists, so the report doesn't cry wolf (on a real 685-GA project: false errors 29 → 6).
- **Validate** (`analyze_all` runs everything): naming & structure · missing status objects
  (ETS-Function roles first, then name-token pairing, **positional pairing** — parallel status middles with 1:1 names — and self-reporting R+T objects) · missing/inconsistent DPTs **+
  sub-DPT sanity** (a "temperature" GA carrying 5.001 gets flagged) · relative-only dimmers ·
  KNX Secure posture (secured vs plaintext, mixed groups, keyring checklist — key material is
  never read) · Matter-readiness · energy-domain coverage.
- **Repair, not just flag** (`suggest_repairs`): infer a DPT from the name, correct a suspect
  sub-DPT, synthesise a missing status GA in a free address slot, add an absolute-brightness GA.
  Suggestions only — a human reviews, accepted GAs feed the ETS export. On a real 3,646-GA
  project: **145 concrete proposals** (32 DPT inferences, 112 synthesised status GAs).
- **Finish the job**: `grade_completeness` (bare skeleton → as-built score), `suggest_names`,
  `diff_projects` (semantic diff of two `.knxproj` revisions: added / removed / DPT-changed /
  renamed / secure-changed), then regenerate the report, handover pack and test protocol.

### 🏠 Scenario 3 — Generate the smart-home layer (Home Assistant)

- **Assembled entities, conservatively**: covers → **colour / dimmable lights** (on/off +
  brightness + RGBW/RGB/colour-temperature + statuses) → switches → **climate** (current temp,
  target-temp status, operation/controller mode, valve value) → sensors/binary. Every entity gets
  a `state_address` wherever the device can report — HA reads *real state*, never assumes.
- **Review-first**: anything ambiguous (DPT 5.001 — brightness or blind position?) is **not
  guessed** — it goes to a `review` list with an explanation (including actuator-dependent cover
  flags like `invert_position` / travel times, which no `.knxproj` encodes).
- **Extras**: `expose` block for date/time broadcast (DPT 19.001), Matter-readiness lint,
  KNX IoT (Turtle/RDF) semantic export.
- Live control of the house stays in the official Home Assistant integration (layer 1) — this
  server only prepares its configuration.
- **Ops companion**: [`skills/ha-git-backup`](skills/ha-git-backup) — the life of your config
  *after* deploy: a real git history of `/config` (deploy key + pre-commit secret scanner) plus
  encrypted offsite backups in GitHub Releases, with a monthly restore drill.

### 🧱 Scenario 4 — Compose a new project from room templates

- **From rooms, not a blank sheet**: pick from six built-in **parametrised room templates** (bedroom,
  children, living, kitchen, bathroom, corridor), choose a `basic` / `comfort` preset **per slot** (a house
  can mix comfort climate with basic lighting), and `compose_rooms` assembles a **new** project.
- **Out comes**: an allocation `manifest` (main = domain, middle = role, sub sequential), ETS-importable
  **GA XML/CSV** via the existing generators, and a **device BOM** proposal from the device library.
- **Validated by the real reader**: the generated `.knxproj` is re-read through the standard `load_project`
  — the same path used for third-party projects — and passes all four linters (naming / missing-status /
  DPT / policy) with **0 errors / 0 warnings**.
- **Dry-run by default, new projects only.** The template format is a public contract (`room_templates/SCHEMA.md`):
  identity is a locale-neutral `slot_id`, never a human name.
- <sub>R2: docking into an existing project + exact device selection — planned.</sub>

### 🧩 The foundation — a growing device library

- `parse_devices_from_project` extracts **exact vendor object models** — including **ref-level** (`ComObjectRef`) publishers like HDL/Ekinex — from the manufacturer
  application programs inside any `.knxproj` / `.knxprod`: object numbers, names, sizes, DPTs,
  C/R/W/T/U flags, per-channel block strides — deterministically, and PII-safe (vendor catalog
  data only; the client project part of the file is never read).
- Point `NICKOL_KNX_CATALOG` at your catalog and `decompose_device` answers with the **exact
  model** (`catalog-exact`) instead of a generic recipe — the catalog grows on demand, from the
  projects and product databases *you* feed it.
- Objects the vendor ships without a declared DPT stay honestly `unverified` — never guessed.

All writes go only into the workspace directory (`NICKOL_KNX_WORKSPACE`, default `./knx-workspace`);
writes outside it are rejected.

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickoScope/nickol-knx-mcp.git
cd nickol-knx-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Dependencies: `mcp>=1.10`, `xknxproject>=3.8`, `PyYAML>=6.0`.

> On Debian/Ubuntu, if pip complains about an externally-managed environment, use a venv (as above)
> or `pip install -e . --break-system-packages`. If `PyJWT` conflicts, run
> `pip install mcp --ignore-installed PyJWT` first.

Verify:

```bash
python tests/test_pipeline.py     # synthetic 16-GA project, end-to-end smoke test
nickol-knx-mcp                    # start the MCP server (stdio)
```

## Connecting to Claude

### Claude Desktop

`examples/claude_desktop_config.json` wires up nickol-knx + filesystem + git + home-assistant.
Minimal fragment (macOS config path: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nickol-knx": {
      "command": "nickol-knx-mcp",
      "env": { "NICKOL_KNX_WORKSPACE": "/path/to/your/knx-workspace" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add nickol-knx \
  -e NICKOL_KNX_WORKSPACE="$HOME/knx-workspace" \
  -- /absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/nickol-knx-mcp
```

Then drop `CLAUDE.md` into your project root — it acts as an ETS Assistant skill (design rules,
safety rules, 3-level GA structure, command/status pairing, DPT discipline, naming, KNX Secure
keyring handling, and the recommended workflow).

**Repair & design**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `suggest_repairs()` | **propose fixes, not just flag** — infer DPTs, synthesise status/brightness GAs |
| `suggest_names()` | naming-hygiene suggestions |
| `decompose_device(order_number, channels?)` | device → GA decomposition: **exact vendor model** from a local catalog (`NICKOL_KNX_CATALOG`), or generic recipe |
| `list_device_recipes()` | the built-in device library (Zennio + ABB families) |
| `parse_devices_from_project(path, output_path?, password?)` | extract **exact device object models** from the app-programs inside a `.knxproj`/`.knxprod` → device-library YAML (feeds the local catalog) |
| `check_device_parameters(path, password?, min_group?)` | **cross-device parameter QA**: find the device whose ETS parameters differ from its N identical siblings (the odd thermostat/sensor out) — `clear_outliers` (likely mistake) + `split_configs` (balanced variants, review) |
| `grade_completeness()` | grade a project: bare skeleton vs as-built |
| `diff_projects(path_a, path_b, …)` | semantic diff between two `.knxproj` versions |

| `project_report(output_path?, name_regex?)` | Markdown report |
| `workspace_info()` | workspace path + safety guarantees |

**Bus-monitor recording** — the project says what a system *should* do; a recording shows what it
*actually* does, including logic that lives outside ETS entirely (a visualisation server or gateway
with no ETS application still writes to the bus). Read-only: this reads an exported `CommunicationLog`
XML, it does **not** connect to a bus. Requires a loaded project — raw frames carry addresses and
bytes, and only the `.knxproj` turns those into names, datapoint types and *expected* senders.
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `load_telegram_log(path, since?, until?, max_records?, from_end?, change_only=true, dedupe_window?)` | stream an ETS monitor recording and cache it. Returns a **summary only**. `since`/`until` take an ISO timestamp or an offset from the start (`+90m`, `-2h`); `change_only` keeps a telegram only when the value on that address changed (typically an order-of-magnitude reduction), and with `dedupe_window` becomes "every change plus a heartbeat every N seconds" |
| `log_overview(top?)` | what's in the recording: traffic by main group, by device, busiest addresses, unknown senders |
| `log_ga_activity(ga?, limit?, senderless_only?, unexpected_sender_only?, min_count?)` | per-GA digest: traffic, senders, value range, `dpt_source`. `ga` accepts an exact address, a prefix (`6/2`), or a zone-template wildcard (`7/x/8`) |
| `log_series(gas, max_points?, agg?)` | time series for several GAs on **identical buckets**, so two signals can be compared directly — how a control loop that exists in no documentation gets found |
| `log_reality_check(limit?)` | **observed traffic vs. the project model**: senders absent from ETS; addresses the project says nothing transmits on that really do get written, and by whom; unexpected extra writers; and what never appeared (reported with the caveat that short-recording silence proves nothing) |
| `log_telegrams(ga?, src?, since?, until?, limit?)` | decoded individual telegrams — last resort, capped at 200; refuses (with the match count) rather than truncating silently |

> **Datapoint types in a recording are often a deduction.** A frame carries bytes, not a type, and
> many projects leave DPTs unset on group addresses. Every decoded value therefore reports
> `dpt_source`: `project`/`object` means the type is declared somewhere; `inferred` means it was
> deduced from payload width and the communication object's function text. An `inferred` value is a
> deduction, not a fact — and a payload that doesn't fit its type falls back to raw hex rather than
> producing a plausible wrong number.

**Room Library** (R1 — compose a new project from room templates)
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `validate_room_template(template?, path?)` | validate a room template (built-in slot_id or a custom YAML) against the R1 schema |
| `compose_rooms(rooms, language="ru", project_name?, output_dir?, dry_run=true)` | build a **new** project from a list of rooms → allocation `manifest`, ETS GA XML/CSV, device `bom` proposal; generated `.knxproj` is re-read by the standard loader and linted (0 errors / 0 warnings). New projects only, dry-run by default. |

---

## Typical workflow

1. `load_project` → point it at your `.knxproj` (+ password if protected).
2. `analyze_all` or `project_report` → read the findings; **human review first**.
3. Fix naming/DPT/status in ETS (by importing generated GAs or manually).
4. `generate_ets_group_addresses(fmt="xml")` → import the missing GAs into ETS.
5. `generate_ha_package` → place the YAML into Home Assistant; resolve `review` items by hand.
6. Keep everything (`.knxproj` export, HA configs, address schema) in Git.
7. Touch the live house only through the Home Assistant MCP (layer 1).

---

## Limitations (honest)

- command/status and category classification is a **heuristic** (DPT + names + ETS Functions). On
  messy projects with no Functions and non-standard names, false negatives/positives are possible —
  which is why the report is always for human review, and ambiguity goes to `review`, not into config.
- DPT 5.001 is structurally ambiguous (brightness vs position); it's disambiguated by keywords —
  double-check with non-standard naming.
- The HA generator is conservative: it would rather defer an item to `review` than emit a wrong entity.
- The server never writes to the bus and never talks to ETS directly — ETS exchange is file
  import/export of GAs only.
- **Validated on a synthetic demo project and on real multi-thousand-GA ETS5/ETS6 projects**
  (anonymised) — but real `.knxproj` files vary enormously, and it is still a beta. Hence the
  [call for testers](#-status--call-for-testers).

---

## 🔒 Safety model

- **No bus access, structurally.** There is no networking or bus library in the dependency tree.
  `workspace_info()` reports `bus_access: false`.
- **Read-only on your project.** `project.py` is the only module that touches `.knxproj`, and it
  only reads.
- **Confined writes.** All output is constrained to `NICKOL_KNX_WORKSPACE`; paths outside it are rejected.
- **Hardened against hostile project files.** A `.knxproj` is an untrusted ZIP-of-XML, so parsing runs
  through `safexml.py`: DTD/entity XML is refused (billion-laughs / XXE), and archives are pre-flighted
  against size / entry / decompression-ratio caps with path-traversal names rejected (zip-bomb defense).
- **Human-in-the-loop.** Generate a `project_report` and review it **before** importing into ETS or
  deploying into Home Assistant.
